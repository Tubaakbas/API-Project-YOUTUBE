Much of this video is based on the following Feynmann lecture
https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_31.html

The explanation for why the phase of a wave produced by a plane of oscillating charges is a quarter phase behind the wave of a charge in the center of that plane, and hence a quarter phase behind that of a light wave inducing the oscillations, is given in the previous chapter:

For the long-time viewers among you, if this sounds familiar, it's because it's a remake of one of the earliest videos on the channel. It's such a wonderful problem, and the audio/pacing in earlier videos was really suboptimal, so I wanted to freshen it up a little here.

A small correction for the integer multiplication algorithm mentioned at the end. A “straightforward” application of FFT results in a runtime of O(N * log(n) log(log(n)) ). That log(log(n)) term is tiny, but it is only recently in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven found an algorithm that removed that log(log(n)) term.

Another small correction at 17:00. I describe O(N^2) as meaning ""the number of operations needed scales with N^2"". However, this is technically what Theta(N^2) would mean. O(N^2) would mean that the number of operations needed is at most constant times N^2, in particular, it includes algorithms whose runtimes don't actually have any N^2 term, but which are bounded by it. The distinction doesn't matter in this case, since there is an explicit N^2 term.

The book by my friend Matt Cook about paradoxes mentioned at the end:
https://amzn.to/3aBrEzg

On the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:
https://amzn.to/3mBDSKE

Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms ""Bayes Factor"" and ""Likelihood Ratio"" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase ""Bayes factor"" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27345/likelihood-ratio-vs-bayes-factor

Timetable:
0:00 - What is the paradox?
5:53 - The Bayes factor
11:00 - The snazzy Bayes rule
14:42 - Contrast with the usual formula

These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Errors:
At minute 16, the sum should be written with a ""..."" to indicate going to infinity.
At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation.
At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!.
At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.  Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.

Mistakes:
In the off-handed remarks on quaternions, I mentioned rotation in 4d would require 10 degrees of freedom.  That's wrong, what I should have said was it requires 6 degrees of freedom, and rotation in 5D is what requires 10 degrees of freedom.

Not on the ""homework"" to show that exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y). This gets a little more intricate if you start asking seriously about whether the series really converge, what they converge to, and how exactly you define a product with infinitely many terms. For anyone curious about the technical details, what you would want to show is that the Cauchy Product of the series for exp(x) and exp(y) converges to the product of the values exp(x) and exp(y) for any particular x and y. That requires the Merten's Theorem.

Curious about measure theory?  This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always-great Terence Tao.
https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/gsm-126-tao5-measure-book.pdf

Also, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle.  Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.

Honestly, given that the code for that video is meant for demo purposes, and not meant to reflect the true data of COVID-19, if you want to apply these ideas to the current situation I'd recommend looking for more professional epidemiological modeling tools that are less centered around animations and pedagogy and more focused on accurate predictions.  For example, the Institute for Disease Modeling has a lot of models free for people to look at and play with.

Data source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#case-tot-outchina

Some have (quite rightfully) commented on how you shouldn't look at the R^2 of linear regressions on cumulative data since even if the changes from one day to the next are completely random, the totals they add up to wouldn't be independent of each other.  Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.

While this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5I

10:28 - The larger scale
14:45 - Dirichlet’s theorem
20:26 - Why care?

Corrections:
18:30: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By ""allowable"", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.

Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.

In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!

My apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.

Not familiar with the calculus referenced in this video?  Try taking a look at this one:

Another perspective from this channel:

And yet another from the blog Better Explained:
https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/

I'm not sure where the perspective shown in this video originates.  I do know you can find it in Tristan Needham's excellent book ""Visual Complex Analysis"", but if anyone has a sense of the first occurrence of this intuition do feel free to share.  It's simple and natural enough, though, that it's probably a view which has been independently thought up many times over.

And to continue my unabashed Strogatz fanboyism, I should also mention that his textbook on nonlinear dynamics and chaos was also a meaningful motivator to do this series, as you'll hopefully see with the topics we build to.

NY Times blog post about this problem:
https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/

The original paper by Gregory Galperin:
https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf

For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.

Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.

Evidently, Numberphile also described this problem (I had not known):
https://youtu.be/abv4Fz7oNr0
You'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.

Discussion on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/3Blue1Brown/comments/a2gqo0/but_why_is_a_spheres_surface_area_four_times_its/

The first proof goes back to Greek times, due to Archimedes, who was charmed by the fact that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of a cylinder encompassing it, and 2/3 the surface area as well (if you consider the caps).  Check out this video for another beautiful animation of that first proof:

These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Thanks to Dan Walsh for many great ideas, and thanks to Mike Hansen for many helpful conversations.

Error correction: I meant to describe Kolmogorov as a “20th-century mathematician” not “19th-century”.  Whoops!  I think during the narration I must have made the classic 1900s vs. 19th-century mix up.  Anyone aware of his work is more than aware of what century he lived in, which apparently applies to quite a few commenters.

And while we're here, the animation at 9:55 misleadingly has the vortex kind of speed up during the transition, which it should not do.  Really, the velocity scales of eddies decrease for lower length scales.

Writing and animations by Sridhar Ramesh, with editing and narration by Grant Sanderson.

Even though we described how winding numbers can be used to solve 2d equations at a high level, it's worth pointing out that there are a few details missing for if you wanted to actually implement this.  For example, in order to determine how often to sample points, you'd want to have some bounds on the rate at which the direction of the output changes.  We will perhaps discuss this more in a follow-on video!

Check out Mathologer's video on the many cousins of the Pythagorean theorem:

On the topic of Mathologer, he also has a nice video about the Basel problem:

Some of you may be concerned about the final step here where we said the circle approaches a line.  What about all the lighthouses on the far end?  Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible.  In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible.  For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.

More on Doppler radar:
Radar basics: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278808

There's a key way in which the description I gave of the trade-off in Doppler radar differs from reality.  Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  

This means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.  See the above article for more information.

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

Huge thanks to my friend Evan Miyazono, both for encouraging me to do this project, and for helping me understand many things along the way.

This is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves.

I will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

Mistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18.  Thanks for the catch!

*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.

What's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.

Because of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.

Several people have commented about how 2^256 would be the maximum number of attempts, not the average.  This depends on the thing being attempted.  If it's guessing a private key, you are correct, but for something like guessing which input to a hash function gives the desired output (as in bitcoin mining, for example), which is the kind of thing I had in mind here, 2^256 would indeed be the average number of attempts needed, at least for a true cryptographic hash function.  Think of rolling a die until you get a 6, how many rolls do you need to make, on average?

Regarding the brief reference to Fermat's Last Theorem, what should be emphasized is that it refers to *positive* integers.  You can of course have things like 0^3 + 2^3 = 2^3, or (-3)^3 + 3^3 = 0^3.

Note, to illustrate my point for the target audience of a new calculus student, I discussed a hypothetical speedometer that makes distance measurements over a very small time.  Interestingly, most actual speedometers in modern cars work by analyzing the induced current of a spinning magnet, which is in some sense the universe implementing the derivative.

There's a slight mistake at 13:33, where the angle should be arctan(1/2) = 26.565 degrees, not 30 degrees.  Arg!  If anyone asks, I was just...er...rounding to the nearest 10's.

And by Affirm: https://www.affirm.com/careers
Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com/

One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension.  The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).

The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose ""Hausdorff dimension"" is greater than its ""topological dimension"".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  

Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.

See Mandelbrot's book ""The Fractal Geometry of Nature"" for the full details and more examples.

Also, in a different video ""What does it feel like to invent math"", I give a completely different example of how adding up growing positive numbers can meaningfully give a negative number, so long as you loosen your understanding of what distance should mean for numbers: https://youtu.be/XFDM1ip5HdU

Interestingly, that vertical line where the convergent portion of the function appears to abruptly stop corresponds to numbers whose real part is Euler's constant, ~0.577.  For those who know what this is, it's kind of fun to puzzle about why this is the case.

For anyone who wants to understand the cross-product more deeply, this video shows how it relates to a certain linear transformation via duality.  This perspective gives a very elegant explanation of why the traditional computation of a dot product corresponds to its geometric interpretation.

Minor error at 1:44, the third line of the matrix should read ""v1 * w2 - w1 * v2""

*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.

*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result, since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.

Dot products are a nice geometric tool for understanding projection.  But now that we know about linear transformations, we can get a deeper feel for what's going on with the dot product, and the connection between its numerical computation and its geometric interpretation.

Error corrections: 
- At one point I mistakenly allude to calculators using the Taylor expansion of sine for its computations, when in reality most use CORDIC (or something like it).
- Around 30 seconds in, there is a typo in how the determinant is written, which should be ad - bc
